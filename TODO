v Check Eltorito bootsector specification for CDROM.
  Currently a floppy is emulated.

  DONE: see DOC/Bootsector.txt


v include acpi.s breaks as [acpi code not committed]
  Filed bug report. 


v: bootloader writing. Currently destroys the target disk's previous
   data, as it writes to the MBR and succeeding sectors.

TODO: bootloader writing: write sector1 and following in the place indicated
  by the MBR. If writing to existing partition, allocate space using
  it's filesystem.

v: PMode. Provide: GDT (Global Descriptor Table)

v: Pmode IDT (Interrupt Table)

v: PIC remapping

v: implement keyboard driver in PMode (depends IDT)

TODO: Task Switching (TSS) (depends PMode)
  partly done - one TSS switch already works. Need to check whether
  a context switch really occurs to make sure.

v construct memory map (ebda, bios rom etc).
  using realmode kernel int 0x12 and int 0x15 to pass map to pmode.
  malloc makes use of the largest block.

TODO: implement Paging
  since it cannot be turned off and it seems like a nightmare it is postponed.

TODO: test acpi_poweroff

v: Shell
  extremely small shell with history, environment variables, and a built-in
  command list. Shell is run from kernel, can be exited to return to
  stage 2 bootloader, which offers shutdown and reboot.

TODO: filesystem
   implemented fdisk.
   implemented FAT16 read access.
   started on 'sfs', custom filesystem. Something akin to git seems worth
   considering.

v: clean up bootloader, separate from kernel. Decisions:
	- whether sector1 is the kernel, or whether it is additional
	  bootloader code. At some point the kernel/sector1 will not
	  be succeeding the bootsector immediately, if compatability
	  with multi-os prepartitioned harddisks is desired.

	* Solution chosen is to separate sector1 into a stage 2 loader
	  and a kernel. The stage 2 loader at current uses a 'ramdisk',
	  a sector marking the start and length of images to be loaded.
	  At current only the first entry is used.
	  The kernel itself will check a signature at the end of it's compiled
	  code+data length to see if it is loaded in its entirety.
	
	- splitting: where to split sector1 from the kernel, where
	  is pmode entered? Goal is to use as little duplicate code as
	  possible.

	* Sector 1 used to include menu, inspector, pmode code. 
	  The 16 bit utilities have been moved and can still be included
	  in sector1, which now only contains the second stage loader code.
	  The pmode code has been moved to the kernel, aswell as all other
	  32 bit code.

	- whether to load the kernel in realmode or in pmode

	* The kernel is loaded in realmode. Loading in pmode would require:
	  o ATA (IDE) drivers; or
	  o VM86 task and monitor to allow BIOS calls; or
	  o switching to realmode for BIOS calls.

	  cons: the kernel loader code would already contain kernel code.
	  pros: kernel size can exceed the availale realmode size
	  of 0xf0000 - 0x4000 = 0xec000 = 966656 bytes = 944 kb when preserving
	  the IVT and BIOS - EBDA may be even before this.

	- whether to implement pmode drivers or do v86/realmode switching

	* Drivers shall be implemented in pmode. The current design then
	  has switched from a monolithic kernel which may grow too big,
	  to a microkernel with loadable modules.
	  The core functionality of the kernel then is to offer BIOS
	  functionality in protected mode: interrupts, irq (keyboard),
	  and storage device handlers.

	* realmode switching implemented to call VESA graphics bios.

TODO: ELF Loader, KFS
	Compile (g++ test.c && objcopy -O elf32-i386 test.o test.o)
	Add to boot.img (write.exe ... -b test.o)
	Modify bootloader: pass on pointer to RAMDISK0
	Add code to kernel to access RAMDISK0 location - KFS.
	Load entry 1 (0=kernel), ELF image.
	Support REL and EXE; in case of EXE subtract base address from
	addresses to make 0-aligned.
	Iterate over relocation table:
		for each symbol update address:
			use kernel ELF image to locate symbol (and its address).
	Change makefile: store REL ELF binary of kernel image. 
	Update loader: locate .text section address (optionally add the
	entry address), and transfer control there.
		Pitfall: there will be data before and after the text section,
		so, need to make sure that the .text and .data sections
		are properly aligned in memory. Likely the ELF format
		does this properly. I assume that the ELF headers and tables
		will be stored before the blocks of data.
		(as to not replicate too much ELF code in the 16 bit loader)
	Keep track of all loaded ELF images as they will be the basis
	for the processes. 
	Finish kernel memory map: it already has access to the realmode
	data bios memory map. Needs to find a suitable memory segment
	for the kernel, for dynamic data maintenance, and for
	processes. Initial approach: take biggest memory segment,
	it'll be last usable one, above 1MB, extending to a little before
	physical memory end - the final segment of unusable data. Make sure
	algorithm can operate on any map ordering.
	Add relocation code. Perhaps split up the pmode code to have it just
	switch to pmode with all interrupts disabled,
	then return to the realmode loader code, do a memory move,
	then continue on with the setup of interrupts etc. Could also
	have the kernel do this, as the GDT needs to be adjusted:
		disable interrupts
		memmove
		update gdt (need to create 32 bit code)
		either zero out the lomem and use memory mapping,
		or zero out just the 32 bit part and keep track of
		the 16 bit kernel location and size.
	
	Investigate Local Descriptor Table. It may be possible to create
	new descriptors without modifying the GDT. In this case,
	create a segment descriptor for code, with limits according to
	the ELF information, aswell as a data selector and a stack
	selector. Find out what exception is generated for data overflows,
	potentially dynamic allocation (i.e. store parameters in registers,
	then access the last address the program expects to be addressable,
	having the gpf detect signature values in the registers to treat
	it like a malloc call.).

	Also, reserve some space BEFORE the elf header for a few simple
	pointers - heap start/end, stack etc.

	Implement ELF translation: assuming the entire image is in memory,
	create a copy by joining the appropriate sections; keep the sections
	(such as symboltable) that are useful.

	Decide whether to keep all process information together:
	process-header | elf headers | symboltable | code | data | stack | heap
	or whether to keep data of the same contextuals scope together:
	process-headers, symboltable... This allows for process mem layout
	to be STACK | CODE | DATA | HEAP.
	Otherwise: PROCESS INFO | LINKAGE | CODE | DATA | STACK | bss | HEAP

	Code needs an API to get a hold of brk()/heap start and end.
	Could either offer a pointer to the process layout, or specify
	a struct, such as     PROCESS INFO | CODE | DATA | ....
	or offer a kernel method that the linkage will refer to.


	ELF MODIFICATIONS:
	add new section type or use .notes or something to record library
	names and versions the file should be linked against. (cant check
	since creating an elf binary on cygwin needs to go through lots of
	weird options (-Wl,--oformat=elf32-i..), but -shared wont work...)
	
	Alternatively, encode the symbol names with library info,
	perhaps an index number into the new section. At current
	all symbols seem to be global, and only parameterizable by section,
	unless the compiler is changed to create elf files with split
	sections for symbol tables (referring to the same progbits/data),
	each section also recording the api name of the library.


Shell: argument escaping

	Use the parsed tokens, write a little grammar for them:
	see process_tokens in shell.s and trash/cd_apply.s

	trashed for now. Tokenizer on character classes is used, along
	with a token merger.

v FileSystem: cd, ls

	implemented fs_opendir/fs_nextentry/fs_openfile/fs_handle_read;
	cd, ls, cat.

	volumes can be mounted in any (nonexistent or existent) directory
	and take precedence, potentially shadowing a filesystem mounted
	in a parent directory.

	Each filesystem type has its own implementation (bits and
	pointers stored in the mtab).
	
	v First attempt: simply only the ability to 
		mount hdb0 /a
		cd /a
		ls
	v next attempt:
		mount hdb0 /a
		ls /a
	v When this is unified, the next attempt is:
		ls /a/directory


v mtab / mount: Mounting filesystems:
	(mounting partitions already works, recording wise).

	v Filesystems may be mounted on top of anything, so opendir
	  should check for the longest match in mtab in order to find
	  the proper filesystem handing code;
	  for permissions and such, a top down approach should be applied.

	v The opendir implementation checks mtab for each directory in the
	  given absolute path.
	  if there is no match it delegates to the current filesystem handler.
	  An interface to hold directory information in a generic format is
	  filled by filesystems. Generic handles are used to keep track
	  of the pointers and allocated buffers.

	The root handler then is the 'memory filesystem', containing
	the virtual root and the mount points,
	aswell as any other custom filesystems (such as a kernel filesystem
	or /dev and such).

	right now the mount point does not have to exist in order to mount
	there.

	
- i8254 does not immediately send packets, only when there are a number of
  them. Possibly due to descriptor ring flags not being cleared properly.

v realmode 'data' is slowly being pushed outside of the 64k range.
  option 1) Consider separating the realmode/pmode code, as the binary formats
    do not allow interleaving code/data segments. So, compile 2 obj files,
    and copy them. Don't want to use elf loading here as the code would need
    to be duplicated in pmode.
  option 2) define all data in .text for realmode/pmode/gdt/idt, anything
    doubly referenced.
  option 3) have a quick enter-pmode in the realmode.s, and
    do the dynamic setup of the GDT in pmode.s.

  DONE: option 2.

  Kernel image layout:

  .text
  - realmode code (.text16 macro)
  - realmode data (.data16 macro)
  - protected mode code (.text32 macro)
  .data
  - protected mode data
    - general data
    - pointer arrays
    - strings
    - driver metadata (pci id's, initialisation code)
    - bss [uninitialized data]. (.bss not supported).


IMPROVEMENT: Optimize static string storage:

	the LOAD_TXT and similar macros define strings in the string
	section.
	Add a tool that rewrites the object file, removing duplicate
	strings, and using offsets into strings and such
	(.e. a="eax", b="ax" => a = "eax", b = a + 1)
	and using the elf/coff string tables to update references
	in code and data.

TODO: offload screen writing in interrupts

  pinging < 1ms, even when print on packet within isr.

  However, time becomes about 12 ms when the screen needs to be scrolled with
  SCREEN_BUFFER enabled, and half that without screen buffer.
  Using movsd instead of movsd reduces it from 6 to 3. The first ping is 
  then 1 ms.

  Wwen doing a similar movsw without referencing video memory the ping
  times become < 1ms again.

  Thus i suspect that on memory access vmware steps in and does a screen update.

BUG: On resume after hibernate of host os, qemu's nic irq/scheduler doesn't trigger.

BUG: since fixing strtok and fs_update_path, the directory is no longer trailed by /.

WORKAROUND: cd /b/

FIXED: symboltable is loaded after kernel's BSS. Stack may run into it, as it is
  64/128 kb beyond kernel end, not beyond symtab end.

FIXED: bootloader's ramdisk kernel load end is before end of bss. This was due
  to not taking the ramdisk FAT into account. Bug was detected by new '-s' option
  to mem.

  - process layout:
     - kernel in hlt loop (idle task?)
     - kb handler checking console activation
     - when console activated, no process is allocated yet
     - enter creates shell process.
     - scheduler updates:
       - round robin scan (skipping gaps).
       - increase task entry struct with flags: one-shot or process.
       - for task flags, the parameter buffer contains all registers.
       - the task executed is executed as usual. A proxy task is used
         for task switches, which uses the data pointed to by edx to configure
	 the registers. TODO: look into using TSS for this.
       - look into a clean exit from the scheduler, as the scheduler will
         have a signature on the stack of whatever process was running,
	 which may cause problems when the scheduler is invoked and schedules
	 that same process again.
	 Requires to unwind stack (add esp, x), and save the cs:eip:flags
	 (aswell as all other registers) in the currently executing task's
	 arguments. The return into the current task is then aborted,
	 and reengaged when the scheduler reencounters the task.
	 Initial approach:
	 - unaware of current task. Simply append a task_switch task to the
	   task queue, parameterized with all registers.
	 - abort returning to currently executing task, and run a task from
	   the queue. If there is no task on the queue, switch to a debug
	   task that prints the time on the screen.

  works on data between symbol locations section_data_str_(start|end).
  removes duplicate strings (saves 2k); uses matching suffix strings.
  Requires symbols to be stored in the .o to find the string references.

  Approach: declare a section .strtab (as a .data area takes about 10kb).
  This area contains fields of 2 dwords: the string data offset, and the
  code offset (within the instruction opcode).
  Also declare the string subsection to be the last one (just before bss).
  During build, manipulate the .o file: pad the unused space in the .strtab,
  and update the start of the bss section and all references to the bss section.
  All .bss data uses labels, which may not be exported if they end with $,
  so, need to find an option to have those present in the object file, and then
  removed from the final object file.
  Another approach is to have objcopy shrink the data section and do the .bss 
  relocation.


TODO: implement .bss
  declare bss start/size constants, and use those in pm kernel to memzero

TODO: IDE UDMA Busmastering.
	Implementing the Intel PIIX4 IDE controller.
	This controller will substitute for the direct legacy ATA interface.
	All calls to ata/atapi_read* etc. must be redirected to use a disk_*
	method, or, opening some generic block device interface, which will
	for now be dev_ide.

	First hack: have ata.s use UDMA through a global constant dev_ide.

	UPDATE: this failed, reverted.

TODO: reorganize OO with dev, pci, ata etc.

	Current status: added oo.s with DECLARE_CLASS_BEGIN/END macros.
	They create a class DECLARATION using a struct relative to SUPER,
	and a class DEFINITION in DATA_SECTION_CLASSES.

	DECLARE_PCI_DRIVER often uses the base class for a particular
	device as it declares the _api. The object size there is 
	not correct for the subclass.

	The api methods are at current specifiable in two ways.
	The first is in the class structure itself. These will
	be copied in dev_newinstance to the dev_api structure,
	which then must match.
	The second way is to only specify in _api, and have the
	object instantiators fill in the methods in the object.

	PLAN:
	- add DECLARE_CLASS_METHODS macro to use between START/END.
	- deprecate dev_get_class_info, or use it as a proxy. Its
	  input is al=DEV_TYPE_..., which is then translated to a class
	  pointer using a local array. The new API would take a direct
	  pointer to the class definition.

	- deprecate the class_pre_constructor which yields the class' 
	  proper object size; this information is now recorded in the 
	  class definition.
	- update DECLARE_PCI_DRIVER by removing any class information
	  except for the class definition pointer. This mainly
	  involves removing the _api/_api_end information,
	  and updating all DECLARE_PCI_DRIVER invocations to use
	  the implementatino class rather than the interface class
	  (such as vmwsvga2 instead of vid, or nic_am79c instead of nic).
	  

	CURRENT STATUS UPDATE:
	
	Implemented inheritable classes in oo.s, calling using DECLARE_CLASS_*
	SECTION_DATA_CLASSES contains fixed-size class definitions.
	SECTION_DATA_CLASS_METHODS contains method pointers; the first dword
	is the offset into the object where the pointer is to be copied. If 0,
	it progresses from class_vptr.
	
	class_newinstance allocates the object by checking the class_object_size
	field. Then it copies the method pointers, if present, and preserves
	the values if they are already stored in the obj. Then it proceeds
	up the class hierarchy, copying but preserving the method pointers.

	The class_newinstance ONLY DOES THIS: allocate, and fill in method ptrs.
	It does NOT call any constructors.

	In pci.s, dev_api_constructor is called after the pci configuration
	registers have been read, and the data entered in the object, which
	is constructed as soon as the class and vendor/device ids have been
	read.

	PCI
	---
	The object construction in PCI goes as follows:
	1) read pci vendor/device id (reg 0) and remember on stack
	2) read, print, and discart reg 4
	3) read pci class/subclass/progif (reg 8)
	4) call pci_find_driver to match vendor/pci_class information
	5) (if found, fetch the pci_driver_class class definition pointer,
	    else use class_dev_pci to at least store the info)
	   and call class_newinstance (in both cases).
	6) proceed to read pci configuration info, storing the relevant parts
	   in the dev_pci part of the class which all drivers must extend.
	7) when all the data is read, dev_api_constructor is called.
	   DISPUTABLE: this may need to be changed to dev_pci_api_constructor.
	
	NOTE: only one constructor is called, as there is as yet no standard
	way to call constructors implemented.

	NOTE: steps 1 and 3 (reading the vendor/device and pci-class stuff)
	are needed for a factory method (i.e., finding the pci_driver and 
	instantiating it: steps 4 and 5).

	NOTE: Step 6, the gathering of pci configuration data, can be seen
	as preparing the arguments for the constructor call in 7.

	Object instantiation then is split into two stages:
	1) bare-bone allocation and set-up: class_newinstance
	2) constructing/initializing the object.

	These have been split, to avoid the need to have a duplicate of
	dev_pci on the stack, containing the argument for the constructor,
	which would then also become a factory method. Before the constructor
	can be called, the object must have been allocated.

	WHAT WORKS:
	- ata and atapi work, as they are called directly from fs.
	- am79c971 driver gets initialized in the OO way.

	WHAT DOESN'T WORK;
	- networking is down, due to the [devices] being bypassed, which
	is used by [nics]. At current the objects are not stored.
	- most drivers need calls to DECLARE_CLASS_METHOD api,impl,OVERRIDE,
	  and so effectively only ata/atapi work.

	PLAN:
	- continue to deprecate devices.
	- implement an object pool using a ptr_array, perhaps using a field
	in the class definition to keep track of objects of the same class.
	- alternate is to also traverse the extension hierarchy and update
	the parent class instance pools, as, the am79c object will be in it's
	own class, alone, whereas it's parent is dev_nic, which remains empty
	except for this approach.
	- implement hierarchical constructor calls, by reserving one dword
	  that cannot be overridden, and perhaps one for the destructor.
	  Perhaps follow the custom route and let the subclass call the parent
	  constructor.
	  (addendm to earlier NOTE: following the hierarchical super() calls,
	  the top call could allocate the object. Further, the PCI config reading
	  can then be done in the constructor of dev_pci; all that is needed
	  is to know the pci class, and vendor stuff, to find the implementing
	  class - and thus it's size).
	- having hierarchical calls, the class_dev default constructor
	  could add the object to the [devices] pool.
	- similarly for NICs.


	UPDATE: nics work properly. Approach is to check all objects
	in [class_instances] to see if they extend from nic, and if so,
	add a pointer to them in the [nics] ptr_array.

	The 'dev' commandline utility does not work, since [devices]
	has been removed entirely.

TODO: PCI BM IDE and ATA
	At current PCI is not required in order to operate ATA.
	The PCI code now implements the PIIX4, which (throug hardcodings
	the ATA ports according to the spec) provides another API access
	point to ATA. 

	The ata_list_drives that initializes ATA should be bypassed
	in case an IDE device operating the same ports is initialized.
	Since the ATA driver supports 8 drives, whereas the IDE driver
	only supports 4 (and it is expected that if more than 4 drives
	are available that there will be 2 IDE devices), 
	the ATA code can then check class_disk or something to see whether
	the drive is already registered.
	Another approach is to reuse the current ATA code as is from
	the IDE driver, which marks the drives as configured,
	and thus the second call has no effect ("listdrives"->ata_list_drives)


FIXED: BUG: am79c doesnt work. CSR0 TXON/RXON are not on;
	CSR15(MODE) 0x80 (PORTSEL0) not remembered and set to 0;
	then init/IDON, after that, CSR15 is 0xf.
	TODO(done):check with clean checkout.
	(TXON/RXON are not set until STRT in clean checkout;
	this is broken; but setting PORTSEL0 fixes this (IENA/RXON/TXON/STRT),
	but, network is broken (no arp, no ISRs).

	I suspect the init block is wrong, or perhaps something overwritten.

	UPDATE: turns out that the init block must be dword aligned.

new scheduling paging stuff
===========================

TODO: re-use task paging structures.
	1) set up one copy of the low-4m page table referencing the kernel
	space, to only allow the exposed api.

	2) use that page for tasks.


TODO: increase memory protection:

	USER TASKS / CPL3:
	------------------
	Disable kernel memory access entirely.
	
	At current some core functions (sockets etc) do a check for CPL0,
	and if not, enter cpl0.

	SOLUTION:
	These API access points must be moved to a particular page.

	ALTERNATIVE: allow execute-only access to the kernel code,
	but disallow data access. 
	The usermode task registers have the same base as the kernel ones
	for easy access. To split read/write access within a single descriptor
	(don't want far-calls), paging can/must be used.

	ALTERNATIVE:
	have all kernel api calls only accessible through an interrupt.


	KERNEL TASKS:
	-------------
	The filesystem, for instance (i.e. ATA), could overwrite important memory.

	Thus, an idea is to have the ATA code run in it's own space,
	with all memory access disabled, except that which it needs.


TODO: SEL_kernelCall etc.: update CR3 perhaps? Set CR3 in TSS?

TODO: rework mem.s to use paging.

	Upside: mrealloc _could_ be faster, by mapping another page after it.
	Conditions: the sizes must be around 4kb....

	Upside: per-task mallocs can be separated.


	APPROACH
	========
	The malloc code as is can remain, with the exception that the base structure
	that is now hardcoded should be parameterized. The same code can then be called
	on multiple 'instances' of managed memory.

	The TLS (task local storage) can contain the pointer, so that the same
	api can be used.
	I.e.:
		malloc:
			mov	esi, [mem_handles]

	becomes

		malloc:
			mov	esi, [tls]
			mov	esi, [esi + tls_mem]
			mov	esi, [mem_handles]
	
	Further, the main heap is still used, so, memory will be allocated there
	and spread out over different tasks.
	This does not prevent a task from overwriting other tasks memory.

	Second, on malloc_aligned, the slack mem is given to the handles as free mem.
	This will then be the memory of that particular task, which is not efficient
	(unless more changes).


	SECOND
	======
	Each task will have a memory address where it's free mem begins.
	On allocation of new memory, a number of pages is allocated
	and mapped consecutively.

	The memory management will then work on that area.

	I.e.:
		malloc_internal:
			while ( mem_heap_avail < eax )
				malloc_page
				append_page
			...


TODO: kernel ring ordering

	Order the code and data according to ring.

	ring0: kernel core
	ring1: scheduler, kernel api
	ring2: IO drivers
	ring3: unprivileged applications

	This change requires far calls.

	For full protection, each ring will be code+data, and page
	aligned.

TODO: file system logging

TODO: IO printing

	This allows to replace the 'stdout' so that printing can be done
	to pipes, files, etc.

DONE: kernel uptime (http) - seems to clip (02h -> 0h)

DONE: cluster uptime: record start date
DONE: have kernel read cmos at boot and store the value, when the PIT is inited
and then provide math to get current date - saves CMOS IO access (no CPL0 needed)
DONE: cluster send kernel revision

FIXED: fix HTTPD memleak: 20 bytes per request, only with Firefox (not with netcat).
