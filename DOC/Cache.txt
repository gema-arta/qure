Caching Kernel
==============

(Also see [Paging] and [Library]).

The kernel can offer a cache for library pages, by using CoW[footnote:copy-on-write].

Versioning Kernel
-----------------

The kernel could be a Versioning Kernel, if it were to take a snapshot of all
memory and record any changes during specified lifecycle events. For
libraries, a snapshot would be made after the static initialisation code has
executed. At this point, data has been loaded from disc, and a function has
been called. We shall assume that it may transform the static data in any way
it sees fit (this also includes containing references to dynamic
resources[footnote:kernel handles such as malloc and IO]).
