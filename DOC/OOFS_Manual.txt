- Partition a disk
  run `fdisk hda init`.

  This will partition the first harddisk with a primary partition taking all
  the space. Run `fdisk hda verify` afterward to modify the partitions using
  a menu frontend.

- Initialize OOFS
  run `mkfs hda0` (or `mkfs -t oofs hda0`).

  OOFS will have created 2 entries:
  * `oofs_vol`, the volume sector, containing sector regions (LBA and numsectors);
  * `oofs_table`, a class lookup table. Implemented as a compact string array,
    each entry corresponding to a region.
  * a synthetic region containing all unallocated space.
  
- Mount the partition
  Typically `hda0` is mounted automatically as `/net` upon a reboot, when the
  cluster service is started, which adds a region `cluster_node`. If not, then
  run `mount hda0 /net`. We'll assume the partition is mounted here from now on.
  
- Add a managed region
  Run `oofs /net add oofs_alloc 1000`

  This will add an entry into `oofs_vol` starting at the free space offset,
  with size 0x1000 sectors.

  You can run `oofs /net` to check the volume descriptor and class table,
  and `oofs /net show oofs_alloc` to inspect the contents of the dynamic
  region, which will show information regarding the linked list, much like
  `mem -h` will show.

  Note, that adding a region does not automatically save it! 
  We now need to execute two save commands:
  
  * `oofs /net save` will save the volume descriptor and the core tables;
  * `oofs /net save oofs_alloc` will persist the contents of the allocation tables.

  Now we can use /net as a file system; `ls /net` will show an emty directory.
  At current the command `mdir /net/foo` will work as expected.
