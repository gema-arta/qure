= Interrupt Tables =

== Real Mode: IVT - Interrupt Vector Table ==

* Start: Absolute Address 0
* Length: 256 * dword = 1024 bytes.
* Range: 0000h - 0400h

Items: a vector: realmode segment, offset.

Size and location can be changed (using ''lidt'').


== Protected Mode: IDT - Interrupt Descriptor Table.

Item size: 8 bytes interrupt vector, consisting of segment and offset;

Three types:
* Interrupt Gates: suspends interrupt handling when invoked.
* Trap Gate: no interrupt suspension.
* Task Gate: switch current TSS (Task State Segment).

The first 32 (00-1F) vectors are reserved for CPU internal exceptions.

Load into the IDT register (IDTR) using ''lidt''.

* 11: idem
* 12: PS2 Mouse
* 13: FPU / inter processor interrupt
* 14: primary ATA (IDE)
* 15: secondary ATA (IDE)

Realmode Interrupt vector offset for Master PIC: 8. Resulting INT: 8..15 (8 + IRQ).
Realmode Interrupt vector offset for Slave PIC: 70h. Resulting INT: 70h..77h.

For Protected mode, the master PIC interrupts need to be remapped so as to not
overlap with the CPU Exception interrupts, by programming the PIC.


= PIC =

The 8259A Programmable Interrupt Controller.

* D7..D0 : data bits
* A7..A0 : INTA pulse data values

How it triggers the CPU: Interrupt Sequence Outputs

It generates 3 INTA pulses (an output bit on the chip).
During each pulse the CPU reads the byte at the data port.
During the first pulse the opcode for the INT instruction (0xcd, 11001101)
appears on the data buffer.

During the second pulse, the lower address of the ISR is programmed
on the data bus.
When interval (a config bit) is 4, A7..A5 are programmed, A4..A0 automatic.
When interval is 8, A7,A6 are programmed, A0..A5 are automatic.

During the third pulse, the higher address (programmed as byte 2
of the initialization sequence) is enabled.

= Kernel Implementation =

Interrupts are currently configurable as follows:
by default all 256 interrupts are directed to
[src:kernel/idt.s#jmp_table_target],
the default interrupt handler. It handles PIC EOI and CPU Exceptions.
Each handler structure is in the code segment:
	# simulate an interrupt call
	pushf
	lcall	SEL_compatCS, jmp_table_target
	jmp	schedule_isr
	.word INT_NR

The old code was similar, except it pushed the interrupt and jumped; however
this would complicate stack examination. Now, `jmp_table_target` examines
the caller address to lie within the handler table and fetch the INT_NR word.

IRQ handlers are registered using [src:kernel/idt.s#hook_isr] which updates
the default call address (`jmp_table_target` above).
The [src:kernel/schedule.s#schedule_isr] handler is the main
scheduler entry point, returning from an interrupt. Both kernel calls and
hardware interrupts will thus invoke the scheduler.

For IRQ handlers (PIC), which are mapped to INT 0x20-0x30
(see `IRQ_BASE` in [src:kernel/pmode.s]), the called address
is [src:kernel/idt.s#irq_isr], which sets up `ds` and `es`
and simulates an interrupt call to registered `isr` routines for the IRQ
using the current `cs`.
These IRQ handlers are registered using [src:kernel/idt.s#add_irq_handler];
devices should simply call [src:kernel/dev.s#dev_add_irq_handler] which
uses the `dev_irq` and `dev_api_isr` device object fields.
