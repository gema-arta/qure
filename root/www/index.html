		<h3 id="nc-intro">Object Oriented Persistent Network Cluster</h3>
		<p>
		Or, OOPNC (I don't think so), applied to assembly, allows for a hardware-efficient
		implementation, such as aligning sector boundaries to page boundaries, and being able
		to load a sector from disc, send it over the network as-is, being mapped transparently
		in the object's data.
		</p>
		<p>The current implementation does not yet do page aligning, but the memory allocator
		already supporting this is used elsewhere and can be adjusted to allow for negative
		offsets relative to an alignment.
		</p>
		<p>Objects can be compiled in two modes: interleaved and compact. These terms refer to
		the spacing of the virtual method pointers, for which space is reserved in the object,
		to eliminate dereferencing.
		<code>
			call	[eax + init]
		</code>
		or whatever alternate syntax for the same expression the assembler accepts,
		is quite clear, and most efficient in a dynamic environment. Certainly, code references
		to methods can be marked and relocated at runtime, to further optimize this. However,
		removing a memory reference from an instruction means a loop making at least two
		memory references will have to be run elsewhere. This loop would iterate over a
		list extracted during the compilation, grouping all references to identical symbols.
		Hence, it is best to not use a hardware instruction, but a macro, to invoke class
		methods.
		<br/>Virtual method pointers are calculated at runtime and cached in static memory,
		in the class data - a singleton, taking the class definition address as it's object
		pointer: static methods. The only difference between a class and an object is that
		the address for the object is allocated at runtime - a variable - whereas the address
		for a class is allocated (determined) at compiletime, and passed to an instruction
		taking a memory reference:
		<code>lea eax, [class]</code>
		</p>
		<h3>Object Oriented Assembly</h3>
		<p>An object with virtual method pointers (VPTR) interleaved with data would
		store memory pointers to disk, if persistent data crosses a class boundary,
		such as when a superclass declares a header for the persistent data.
		All data declared by superclasses is concatenated into the object address space.
		Grouping the virtual pointers together, they can be placed at the beginning.
		The pointer that the class methods take ('this') is offset by the size of the
		VPTR table, thereby making method symbols consecutive integers. The first area
		before the object's adjusted address (let's call it 0), will contain the method
		pointers to the topmost class. Before them, it's subclass, and so on. This is mirrored
		on the data side. This way, object data is split in two, one side being an array
		of fixed size elements, and one side variable data.
		</p>
		<pre>
		class base
		{
			<span class="b">long a;
			long b;
			method init;</span>
		}

			#.long init, a, b
			# -4: init
			#  0: a
			#  4: b
			 

		class sub extends base
		{
			<span class="s">long c;
			method foo;</span>
		}

			#.long <span class="s">foo,</span> <span class="b">init, a, b</span>, <span class="s">c</span>
			#<span class="s">-8: foo</span>
			#<span class="b">-4: init</span>
			#<span class="b"> 0: a</span>
			#<span class="b"> 4: b</span>
			#<span class="s"> 8: c</span>
		</pre>
		<p>
		So far, no dereferencing has to take place: both variable method pointers (VPTR) aswell
		as variable data is adressable in an extensible way (inheritance). Certainly, code does
		not need to use this addressing scheme, and can call the methods directly using their
		static address. With purely top-down inheritance, such method access can be resolved
		at compile time. However, when an object starts calling it's class's methods itself,
		and thus accesses itself through it's virtual interface, it allows any subclass to
		change the functionality of those methods. Other than that, there is no need for virtual
		pointers. Code is written to interface with a class, and thus, at compile time,
		the expected method is known. A caller, using a method reference, allows to substitute
		for execution of any algoritm (such as upgrading the kernel and rebooting the machine).
		Obviously, such an algorithm would be protected by the kernel, since only it knows
		the exact conditions under which to access the routines.
		</p>
		<h3>NetOBJ: Networked Objects</h3>
		<p>
		A network address space is reserved. Generally speaking, IP addresses, protocol numbers,
		port numbers, MAC addresses, all combined, is merely a bitstring. Calling the parts
		by different names does not change their meaning. Reserving the address space
		means to expect a certain protocol on that address. (At current this is UDP:999, which
		at this time is not reserved by IANA).<br/>
		To reduce overhead, a simple mechanism for determining whether a network packet is
		indeed to be treated as the protocol is implemented. It first consists of IP filtering
		(the private broadcast address: 255.255.255.255), UDP port filtering, and a signature
		check at the beginning of the packet. The signature is at current <code>.asciz "hello"</code>.
		A checksum as the first word, would provide a hint, although, this does not guarantee
		a protocol, merely that at a specific location a checksum is present. The simplest
		checksum - adding words - does not impose an order on the packet.
		If the location of the checksum were overlapping with another protocol, say TCP,
		packets could still be confused, if the protocol were determined by calculating
		the checksum and scanning the payload to find the location of the checksum. Ofcourse,
		in the case of UDP vs. TCP this cannot happen since the protocol number is stored
		in the IP header. However, it is conceivable that other protocols extending UDP use
		the same location for the checksum, which makes it insufficient to determine the protocol
		of the packet.
		</p>

		<h3 id="pnc">Persistent Network Objects</h3>
		<p>
		Not all data on the network needs to be persisted on disk, and vice versa.
		Persistent Network Objects (NOP [why not]), are Network Objects extending
		from Persistent Objects. It could have been the other way around, but that's
		not how this is implemented. Persistent objects can have the persistent part
		of their data at any offset and length in their data. This allows complete
		freedom to subclasses to organize their data. Networked objects extend this
		behaviour by adding a network window. Two labels are defined, marking the
		beginning and ending, which are passed as begin and length, to the IO method.
		The base class implementing persistence, contains the region information,
		which consists of an array of elements. Each element contains the size of
		the region, which allows to calculate the region's beginning address and
		avoid persisting this. However, this space is reserved, making the volume
		sector an array of { offset, length } structures:
		</p>
		<pre>
		struct {
			long count;
			struct
			{
				long lba;
				long sectors;
			} array[];
		}
		</pre>
		<p>
		The lba field is merely a runtime cache, but can be used for other purposes
		on disk. The object representing the region may remember a value in it's
		data, which is passed to it on load, and returned on save (of the outer struct,
		the base class - the volume sector).
		</p>
		<p>
		The root sector object simply loads one sector at the LBA given it by the
		file system - the partition beginning. It checks a signature field (omitted),
		calculates the size of the array (<code>count*8</code>), checks if it is more
		than a sector, and if it correlates with the information passed by the filesystem,
		before it proceeds to resize itself (<code>mreallocz</code>) and loading all the
		sectors (1).<br/>
		The LBA passed to it by the parent (not super!) is not persisted on 
		disk, only the number of sectors - the partition size. The first entry on disk
		would then be <code>(0, size)</code>, indicating free space, however, instead,
		the maximum size of the array is stored there <code>(0, 1)</code>.
		For convenience, it stores the remaining free space on disk as the last array entry:
		<code>(1,size-1)</code>, although this can be calculated. This allows to check
		whether the partition was resized.
		</p>
		<p>
		The next defined class is a symbol table, implemented as a string (henceforth
		array) where names are separated by 0.
		To find the index of a string requires to scan the list
		incrementally, which is slow, but, for a small number of strings, irrelevant.
		The list can be scanned once, to compress the string sizes and construct
		a sorted offset table (perhaps a tree). Yet, this is a caching extension,
		proper for a subclass.
		</p>
		<p>
		The symbol table consists of class names. The first entry correlates with the
		first region - the root sector. Yet, it does not know about the symbol table
		region, unless it is told by the file system / partition driver, which is
		responsible for initializing the second region (the symbol table). Therefore,
		the first two entries are as yet not dynamic, even though after they are loaded,
		they can be reinstantiated using the classnames specified in the string table.<br/>
		</p>
		<p>The classname in the stringtable is correlated with a class definition by
		traversing the class definition section (<code>.classdef</code>) in the kernel
		library. Device drivers use OO, and need to be privileged to do IO, which is why
		the class definitions for some base classes (<code>dev</code>) are present in the
		kernel library itself.<br/>
		The kernel itself does not declare any classes except the <code>class</code> class,
		which is hardcoded. The dynamic data (from the perspective of the kernel),
		being class definitions, are allocated in a different memory space (ring 2).
		Code operating on this data then can be called by the kernel and run with
		lesser privilege. Only device drivers and the shell use the OO system, at current.
		</p>
		<p>
		An network object then consists of the following regions:
		</p>
		<pre>
		volatile:
		 A:
		packet_start:
		 B:
		persistent:	# network data:   BC
		 C:
		packet_end:	# persistent data: CD
		 D:
		persistent_end:
		 E:
		volatile_end:	# volatile: A E
		</pre>
		<p>
		The above shows that the packet overlaps with the data.
		Ofcourse, there are more combinations.
		Linear extension would append a similar scheme to this to construct the
		subclass data. A choice then needs to be made whether to extend the
		persistent data, or whether to extend the network data. This results
		in two subclasses, a base for network extension, and a base for
		persistence extension. Obviously, any kind of extension is possible,
		but not all of them can be optimized to remove copying (concatenating)
		memory alltogether.<br/>
		Example:
		</p>
		<pre>
		class X {
			volatile: 		.space A
			packet_start:		.space B1
		}
		class Y extends X {
			packet_payload1:	.space B2
			persistent:		.space C1
		}
		class Z ends Y {
			persistent_packet_data:	.space C2
			packet_end:		.space D
			persistent_end:		.space E
		}

		<span class="x1">A</span>	volatile
		<span class="x2">BC</span>	packet
		<span class="x3">CD</span>	persistent
		<span class="x1">E</span>	volatile
		</pre>
		<p>
		Naturally, class Z does not need to specify both <code>packet_end</code>
		and <code>persistent_end</code>,
		and can choose to let itself be extended either way.<br/>
		Another useful feature is that a subclass can indicate where to truncate the parent
		class. Given the following:
		</p>
		<pre>
		class X {
			a: .space A
			b: .space B
		}
		class Y extends X {
			c: .space C
		}
		</pre>
		<p>
		class <code>Y</code> will have the object structure <code>A B C</code>.
		Class <code>Y1</code> on the other hand:
		</p>
		<pre>
		class Y1 extends X at b {
			c: .space C
		}
		</pre>
		<p>
		will have the object structure <code>A C</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
		At current, class <code>Y1</code> would be declared using macros as follows:
		<pre>
		DECLARE_CLASS_BEGIN Y1, X, offs=b
		c: .space C
		DECLARE_CLASS_END Y1
		</pre>
		<p>
		The above has dealt with aligning and extending network and persistent data in
		a few levels of inheritance. Ofcourse, multiple persistent and/or network regions
		may be present in a class hierarchy.<br/>
		Network cards often allow to specify multiple pointers in a queue structure,
		where a field indicates whether to concatenate this memory region with the next
		to construct a packet (<code>EOP</code> - end-of-packet).
		[the data] A list of pointers [refers to] can then be concatenated in hardware,
		constructing a packet. A similar scheme can be employed for disk access,
		although the granularity is poor (512 bytes) relative to network IO (1 byte).
		</p>

		<h3 id="oofs">OOFS Object Oriented File System</h3>
		<p>
		Having constructed the two regions: sector allocation table (SAT)
		using fixed sized elements (2x32 bits), and string table (variable length),
		it then is possible to fetch the name for any region. When the name
		is interpreted as a classname, it is possible to dynamically instantiate
		objects for all known regions automatically, passing along the persisted
		data and a means to overwrite it.
		One extension could be to allow, after the signature, the count field to
		specify how much sectors should be loaded into the object.
		</p>
		<p>
		At current, the third entry is <code>cluster_node</code>, although which
		region it is does not matter, as all names in the second region are scanned to yield
		an index into the first region. <br/>
		It is now even possible, to allocate partitions within the partition,
		and store the name of the class implementing any filesystem.
		</p>
		<p>
		The case where the data to be persisted exceeds the region space needs
		to be handled by the first sector, in charge of sector allocation.
		It could employ an allocation table approach, although efficiency
		will be lost. Since at current the beginnings of all regions are
		read consecutively, they are compact. It is faster to read 8 objects
		in a single 4kb read, than to reserve space to prevent copying later.
		The initial scheme will be to maintain compactness. If the last region
		extends [it's size], nothing needs to be done except update the first sector
		(which can hold reference to (512-8)/8 regions, theoretically twice
		that many). Ofcourse, the first region is not expected to grow much,
		leaving room for most of it's space to be allocated to a single
		region implementing a complex system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Example:
			<pre>
	<span class="x1">mov	eax, offset mountpoint		# string reference
	call	mtab_get_fs			# eax &lt;- class_fs instance for mountpoint</span>
	jc	exception1
	<span class="x2">mov	edx, offset class_fs_oofs
	call	class_instanceof</span>
	jc	exception2
	<span class="x3">mov	eax, [eax + root_obj]
	mov	edx, offset class_cluster_node	# or any class definition
	call	[eax + lookup]			# eax &lt;- persistent network object</span>
	jc	exception3
	<span class="x4">call	[eax + cluster_node_send]</span>
		</pre>
		<p>
		Or, in another expression:
		<pre>try {
	<span class="x2">( (fs_oofs) <span class="x1">mtab_get_fs( mountpoint )</span> )</span>
	<span class="x3">-&gt;root_obj-&gt;lookup( class_cluster_node )</span>
